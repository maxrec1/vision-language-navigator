### TB4 POV Video

![Video 2](vision-navigator-tb4-pov%20(1).mp4)

Demonstrates the TurtleBot4 perspective during navigation:
- **Top screen**: Gazebo simulation showing the robot in the warehouse environment
- **Bottom screen**: Robot's camera view showing what the TB4 sees in real-time

### Command Parser Video

![Video 2](vision-navigator-command-parser.mp4)

Shows the natural language command processing system:
- **Note**: The first query takes longer to process as the system initializes models and loads resources
- **Subsequent queries**: Execute much faster due to cached models and initialized components
